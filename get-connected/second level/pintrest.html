  <p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/roastedroot/the-roasted-root/">The Roasted Root</a>- This is a board that features vegan and GF ideas from their blog. The ideas are healthy and interesting. They are also really good about incorporating any other allergies into recipes. I found some GF Almond Butter Pumpkin Bars on this pintrest board and plan to make them as soon as I am at home for the holidays.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/faveglutenfree/">FaveGlutenFree</a>- This is a pinner who has many boards dedicated to GF eating. Everything from cookies to  pizza is mentioned here. I pinned some GF Peanut Butter Blossom Cookies(the ones with the hershey kiss in the middle) because they are my all time favorite cookie but havenâ€™t seen a recipe for them until now.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/jdrummond/">Peanut Butter and Peppers</a>- This has a strange name but this pinner is all about healthy eating and cooking. Not all of their food is GF but a lot of it is. I pinned a Butternut Squash Wild Rice as well as a Roasted Root Vegetable recipe that look absolutely delicious.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/gfreegoddess/">Gluten Free Goddess</a>- This is Karina from Portland, Oregon who has over 30 boards dedicated to GF eating. All her recipes are easy to follow and she uses mostly organic and natural foods because her home allows her to. I have found and then actually made many of her recipes. One that I have made is Raspberry Coconut Almond Bars which were so good I brought them to my Christmas dinner. Definitely a good board to look at.</p>
