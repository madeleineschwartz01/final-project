<p><h1>What I've Learned</h1>
<h1>Don’t be afraid to ask!</h1> This applies to practically everywhere you go: restaurants, over a friend’s house, supermarket, etc. It makes a difference asking whether an item has gluten in it or not because at least for me, it will save me days of problems down the line. Waiters should know what is in their foods and can ask the chef if they don’t. Same goes for supermarkets, if you are looking for a specific item, just ask someone. Also, if your friend is really your friend, you should be able to ask questions about what they are serving you. I was nervous for a long time about asking people about their food and sometimes still do, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. You are not being annoying or causing a scene, you are protecting your health.

<h1>Bring your own</h1> This is a great mindset to have for parties or events where you know there will be little to no gf food. When your friend is having a party, make sure to bring something that you can eat but everyone can also enjoy. When you are meeting up with a friend for the day and know that you won’t be able to just pop in a grab anything at a nearby store, bring a snack just in case. I have a friend who always has a bag of cereal in her purse and brings it everywhere. The old motto of just in case really does apply here.

<h1>Talk to someone who knows</h1> For me, this was the nutritionist at college but it could be a doctor or someone else who can give guidance. My nutritionist is a great resource for me because she orders all of my gf food. I can tell her what I want and she can get it. A doctor can give suggestions as to how to improve your diet or maintain a healthy lifestyle. I have also found that people who have been gf for a long time have great insight on how to eat healthily and stay that way for years.

<h1>There is no normal!</h1> I have learned to embrace eating gluten-free instead of being embarrassed or shy about it. At first, I wouldn’t tell anyone about it and keep it a secret but it just made my life harder. Everyone has their issues and it isn’t that rare for you to not be the only one at a party that is gf. No need to get on a loud speaker and announce to the room but telling the hostess or some friends will help in the long run and be people to confide in.

<h1>Get a support system</h1> My family is my rock. When I was first diagnosed and had to go gluten-free, I didn’t want to do it. I had been eating gluten for 16 years and I had no desire to switch my diet upside down, but I luckily I had my family to help me. I started out small by eating just one gf meal a day. Then once this became easy, I increased my gf foods and eventually quit gluten cold turkey. My family is great with coming up with new ways to incorporate gf foods into the holidays and finding fun recipes to try. When I get frustrated that I am different or that I just freaking miss the taste of regular pretzels, they let me rant and calm me down. Although it gets easier with time, it’s not smooth sailing 100% of the time and your support system makes the ride that much easier.</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
