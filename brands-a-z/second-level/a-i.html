  <h1>A-I</h1>
  <p><strong>A</strong>:</p>
  <p> <strong>Ancient Harvest-</strong> Makes a great quinoa and quinoa pasta. I love the Harmony Blend quinoa, perfect for bringing to work for lunch. All natural and available in most grocery stores. All products come in a turquoise box.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Absolutely Gluten Free-</strong> Amazing crackers that taste so good, non gluten-free people buy them! The original flavor both in crackers and flatbreads are a staple for family parties at my house.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Annies-</strong> This brand prides themselves on organic, all natural products. They sell some salad dressings that are great. The Raspberry Vinaigrette is very tasty.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Amy’s Kitchen-</strong> Great brand. I don’t eat it often but when I do, I love it. Sometimes their products are harder to find, sometimes a health food store is the only place I can spot it. Their products are gluten-free versions of great lunch and dinner options. The Asian Noodle Stir-Fry has great flavor as does the Cheddar Burrito. </p>

  <p><strong>B:</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>Bob’s Red Mill-</strong> This brand is great for flour blends. If you don’t already know, gluten-free baking can involve complicated flours such as White rice Four, Xanthum gum, and chickpea flour. Bob’s red mill has them all for pretty good prices.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Bakery on Main-</strong> This brand makes many things but I absolutely love their granola. The Cranberry Orange Cashew Granola is so good I could eat an entire bag in a day. </p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Bionaturae-</strong> THE BEST PASTA. I eat this pasta and only this pasta. Their pasta is made from rice flour as well as other gf starches that, if cooked correctly, tastes the same as normal pasta. Can’t stress how good this brand is.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Betty Crocker-</strong> Now I know this may sound strange, mentioning Betty Crocker, but her brownie and cake mix is really good. Tastes like her original recipes and is available in most grocery stores.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/red-mill.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/><img src="../../images/bakery.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/><img src="../../images/bionaturae.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/><img src="../../images/betty.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/></p>
  <p><strong>C:</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>Chebe-</strong> This is a bread mix company that has gotten great reviews by my gf family members. I’ve never personally worked with it but I’ve eaten it and it is pretty good. The pizza crust has great texture.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Cherrybrook- </strong>This is a brand that makes baking mixes such as brownies and cakes. The mixes are in most every grocery store.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Chex-</strong> A common brand but a staple for me a school. There are 7 gluten-free flavors. My favorite is the traditional corn chex for breakfast and cinnamon chex for dessert or a snack. Note: the wheat chex are NOT gluten-free.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Cup 4 Cup- </strong>This is a small company that makes great flour blends. They try to eliminate the difficulties with gf baking. In their recipe, the amount of Cup4cup gluten-free flour equals the same as any normal wheat flour. This cuts out all funky conversions that most gluten-free flour mixes require.</p>

    </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>D:</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Deboles-</strong> Deboles is another pasta brand that is largely available and behind Bionature it is pretty good.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/deboles.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/></p>
  <p><strong>E:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Enjoy Life Foods-</strong> This brand has a variety of products but some are better than others. Their best is called Plentils which are chips made from lentils. The sea salt flavor tastes just like Lays. Note: the cereal bars have a texture similar to rubber, Beware.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/enjoy-life.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="200" class="image"/><br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>F:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Food Should Taste Good- </strong>GREAT TORTILLA CHIPS. The Sweet Potato chips are my absolute favorite. Great flavor, texture, and all organic. Readily available and the prices are pretty good. Definitely a try if the brand is new to you.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/fstg.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="250" class="image"/></p>
  <p><strong>G:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Glutenfreeda</strong>-This is my lifesaver while away at college. Their oatmeal has the BEST flavor and in my opinion is better than normal oatmeal. I’ve tried all of their varieties and have made my nutritionist order them for me at school: that’s how good they are. I always get the variety pack which has the Apple cinnamon, Banana Maple, and Maple Rasin in it. All are great but I’m not a banana super-fan so the others win in my book.</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Glutino-</strong>Well known brand with some great products. Their granola bars, especially the buleberry flavor, have amazing texture. Glutino bagel chips and pretzels are also good and I bring them to Thanksgiving each year to eat with appetizers.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/glutenfreeda.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/> <img src="../../images/glutino.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="225" class="image"/></p>
  <p><strong>H:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Haagen-Dazs-</strong> A classic dessert brand that makes great sorbet. The mango and Raspberry flavors are really tasty.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../images/haagendaz.png" alt="" width="250" height="250" class="image"/></p>
  <p><strong>I:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Imagine Foods-</strong> This brands has really good soups. I like the butternut and acorn squash with mango. Good flavor and is just thick enough. I eat these on occasion at school when I can find it.</p>
