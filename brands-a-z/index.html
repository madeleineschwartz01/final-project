  <p>As a student in New York City, I have been able to find some amazing gluten-free options and luckily for us, there are more appearing every day. Many people, including some well-known celebrities, have recently jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon which has made finding quality gf food easier. However, even with this influx of brands and products, my motto has always been “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. If you find a brand that you love, stick with it. Great, and I mean really great, tasting gluten-free foods are far and few between so when you find a gold-mine, treasure it.</p>
  <p>As I was thinking of my favorite brands, so many came to mind. There are some companies that I eat every day and couldn’t live without but there are also some specialty brands that, although I don’t eat very often, when I do I fall back in love with them immediately. </p>
  <p>Here I have broken down the alphabet and listed my favorite brand names with a short description. Some have more than one brand name because oddly, some letters have an abundant number of options to chose from and they were all so good I had to include them. If you haven’t tried some of these, you’re missing out!</p>
